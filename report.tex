\section{Introduction}

\section{General Formulas}

If a polynomial is of degree 4 or less, the roots can easily (relatively) be found with explicit formulas.
Galois showed us that there is not an explicit formula for 5th degree polynomials and above.

\subsection{Quadratic Polynomials}

For polynomials of the form $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots are of the form
\begin{equation}
	x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},
\end{equation}
as many people know from seventh or eighth grade. 

\subsection{Cubic Polynomials}

For a polynomial of the form $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the formula for the roots is slightly more complex than that of quadratic polynomials.\cite{wiki:cubic}
\begin{equation}
	x_k=-\frac{1}{3a}\bigg(b+u_kC+\frac{\Delta_0}{u_kC}\bigg),\,k\in{1,2,3},
\end{equation}
where 
\[u_1=1,\,u_2=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2},\,u_3=\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}\]
are the cubic roots of unity and
\[C=\sqrt[3]{\frac{\Delta_1+\sqrt{\Delta_1^2-4\Delta_0^3}}{2}},\]
with 
\begin{align*}
	\Delta_0 =& b^2-3ac \\
	\Delta_1 =& 2b^3-9abc+27a^2d.
\end{align*}
Also,
\[\Delta_1^2-4\Delta_0^3=27a^2\Delta,\]
where $\Delta$ is the discriminant, $18abcd-4b^3d+b^2c^2-4ac^3-27a^2d^2$.

This formula was probably not taught to most middle schoolers.

\section{Newton's Method}

\begin{equation}
	x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\end{equation}

\section{Graeffe's Method}

Let $p$ be a polynomial of degree $n$, where 
\[p(x)=(x-\zeta_1)(x-\zeta_2)\dots(x-\zeta_n).\]
Then,
\[p(-x)=(-1)^n(x+\zeta_1)(x+\zeta_2)\dots(x+\zeta_n).\]

\section{Analytic Functions}

\subsection{Argument Principle}

According to \cite{delves1967numerical},
if $C$ is a closed curve in the complex plane which does not pass through a zero of $f(z)$, and $R$ is in the interior of $C$, 
then
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:arg-princ}
	s_n=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_Cz^N\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=\sum_{j=1}^vz_j^N,
\end{equation}
where $z_j,j\in\{1,2,\dots,v\}$ are the zeros of $f$ which lie in $R$.
A multiple zero is counted according to its multiplicity.
When $N=0$, equation \ref{eqn:arg-princ} gives the number of zeros in $C$.
This is a result of the argument principle.\cite{wiki:argument-principle}

Unfortunately, calculating $s_n$ using the Residue Theorem usually involves finding the roots anyways.

\subsection{Numerically Finding Roots}

\cite{delves1967numerical} gives a method, which I will refer to as the "Delves-Lyness Method", for numerically locating the zeros of an analytic function (hence the title),
which has four sections:
\begin{enumerate}
	% 1
	\item Evauluate the number of roots, $s_0=v$, in the region.
	If the number is manageble, calculate $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_v$, and carry on to step (3).
	Otherwise, continue.
	% 2
	\item
	Subdivide the region into smaller subregions and repeat step (1).
	% 3
	\item Given a region and $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_v$, construct and solve the equivalent polynomial $p(z)$.
	% 4
	\item Optionally, take the roots of $p(z)$ as approximations to the roots of $f(z)$,
	and refine these using an iterative method on $f(z)$.
\end{enumerate}
The paper considers two shapes for $R$, squares and circles, 
and  gives three methods for determining $s_N$ in the case of circles.
